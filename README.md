# Frontend A1 Asignment for Fable-Journey Hiring: Visual Representation of a Binary Tree

Hello,
I have created this in the simplest bare bones manner possible. There is just simple use of useState alogn with div and span tags. I can bet there is no simpler logic possible for this problem.

LOGIC: I created an array of input elements and assigned each button element a span tag and every (2 to power n -2)th element was rendered with a <br/> tag which leads to a new line. 
Hence the pyramid strucure is achived.  


I have not done any complex stuff like creating opjects to store left and right child etc cuz it was not specifically mentioned in instructions.

Also I am not familier with D3 library so couldn't use it and there is no way of creating lines between elements without external library 
(one other option was React-Connect-Elements library), but we were specifically asked to not use any other libraries.

PS: I am a bit late cuz it was a working day (Friday).
